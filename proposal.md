Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *SCIPY*

*SciPy is a Python-based open-source software library that is designed to provide a broad range of scientific and technical computing capabilities. The library is built on top of the NumPy library, which provides efficient array operations and linear algebra routines, and extends its functionality with additional modules for optimization, integration, signal processing, and more. The SciPy library is widely used in fields such as physics, engineering, data science, and finance, and provides a flexible and powerful platform for scientific computing and data analysis. Overall, SciPy is a vital tool for anyone working with scientific data and computations in Python, and continues to be actively developed and maintained by a large community of contributors.*
